## Getting started

To get started on your Team Scorched journey, type */link* in the [#bot](https://discord.com/channels/885424375321464893/885434418733391912) chanel. This will create your account and give you access to the botâ€™s commands. You can find more details on nblock's [info page](https://scorched.nblock.dev/).

## Earning scoins

Once you've signed up with the bot, you'll start earning scoins by simply playing Team Scorched. Winning will give you more scoins and so does playing solo. Make sure to upgrade your cannon regularly as better cannons also give you more scoins per match.
