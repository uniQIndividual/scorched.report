Team Scorched Speedruns are purely for fun and the rules will reflect that. PvP speedrunning has inherently many problems which is why you shouldn't take this too seriously.

## Submitting

- The video should not start with or after the first visible frame. Otherwise the timing starts from 7:00 which will be higher.
- It should probably be in Team Scorched?
- Submit the video in the Scorched Realm discord server.

## Timing

All categories are timed similar to how [other d2 speedrunning communities do it](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16IoHPtkWEaRYjBa5ibDk76fj-FHVUEhePr-n-EH0kdo/edit).

The timing starts with the first visible frame in the match. You probably want to use editing software or change your graphics card settings to spot the difference from complete darkness.

The timer is stopped on the first frame where the hp bar drops to zero and the guardian model changes. We'll figure out what to do if that's not visible lol
