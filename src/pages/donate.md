Scorched Report is specifically designed in a way so it does not create any noteworthy ongoing expenses for me. If you want to donate money to Destiny 2 fan projects please consider the following projects currently looking for funding:

- [Andrew Sun](https://andrewsun.com/donate/) (Destiny 2 Post Game Carnage Report Dataset)
- [Crucible Report / Trials Report](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/trialsreport)
- [Braytech](https://bray.tech/settings/subscriptions)
- [D2 Foundry](https://ko-fi.com/gothfemme)

If you want to donate your resources to scorched.report, I'd be very grateful for one of the following:

- design input (as you can tell that is not my strength)
- bungo-pgcr-15b
- a way to supply me with PGCRs in somewhat regular intervals without me having to build my own crawlers
- suggestions
- bug smashing
