# Scorched Report

Scorched Report was mainly created by uniQ with a lot of help from nblock. The Scorched Cannons was kindly created by GerbSnail and the TWAS entries by our resident lore guardian, Jon. Please keep in mind that Scorched Report is just a fun project some of us wanted to embark on. We might update things or we might not.

## The inner workings

The Scorched Report website is built upon [Astro](https://astro.build/) to easily create static content, while all dynamic elements are embedded React components. The entire code for the website is open source and available on [GitHub](https://github.com/uniQIndividual/scorched.report). It also heavily utilizes Tailwind CSS. The data elements are created with a heavily modified version of [zstd-jsonl-filter](https://github.com/uniQIndividual/zstd-jsonl-filter) that is currently not public. I might be able to send you filtered dataset for Team Scorched (or other game modes) upon request.
